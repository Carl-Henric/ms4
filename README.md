## MS4 - Old And Gold Vintage watch eCommerace
"header image"

Old And Gold is my fictive webshop with handpicked exclusive vintage watches. Each watch is one of a kind and theres is only one of each watch. 
I wanted the site to be very straight forward with few categories and minimize objects that can distract the visitor form proceeding a purchase. 

The target audience is watch entusiasts that are seeking for a specific watch thar are hard to find. Old And Gold is only 
selling Rolex, Omega and Patek Phillipe beacuse they have the most strong purchase power audience.

## Structure
The site consists of:
+ **Homepage**

    Introduce the concept of Old & Gold for the first time visitor and what to expect for the visit. 
    Helps the user forward in to the site.  
    ***
+ Categories (All watches, Rolex, Omega and Patek Philippe)
 
    There is four categories where the watches is displayed. Due to the small assortment I wanted to keep it easy for the user to find the watches. 
    I kept the categories linked to the brand and not to the uses for the watch. 
    ***
+ Product detail

    The product detail page displays all the info about each watch. I wanted the info about each watch to be shorthanded and easy to understand but with all the required info clear to the user. 
    The most important info for a vintage watch is year, condition and price.
