## MS4 - Old And Gold Vintage watch eCommerace
"header image"

Old And Gold is my fictive webshop with handpicked exclusive vintage watches. Each watch is one of a kind and theres is only one of each watch. 
I wanted the site to be very straight forward with few categories and minimize objects that can distract the visitor form proceeding a purchase. 

The target audience is watch entusiasts that are seeking for a specific watch thar are hard to find. Old And Gold is only 
selling Rolex, Omega and Patek Phillipe beacuse they have the most strong purchase power audience.
